                <p class="usa-font-lead">This December, in honor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper's Birthday</a>, GSA will be hosting a competition for all open source contributors to redesign the GSA Open website, open.gsa.gov.  Open.gsa.gov is the current developer portal for all GSA data, APIs, and source code open to the public.  This competition is hosted by GSA’s IT Digital Services team and will be held on Friday, December 9th, 2016.  The goal of this redesign is to improve public engagement with GSA digital assets and increase understanding and awareness of agency open technology.  GSA challenges developers and designers from industry, academia, and federal government to create solutions using the site product roadmap provided on the competition details webpage.</p>
                <p class="usa-font-lead">More info will be posted here when details are available. Stay tuned!</p>
