      <p>The NDC is developing a special systematic declassification review program for previously reviewed and exempted historical federal records that were accessioned to the National Archives and reviewed prior to the creation of the center in 2010. This pilot activity will be followed with a formalized process to make re-review of previously exempted records a priority for the NDC.</p>

OGIS will seek partnerships with outside educational and library organizations to create and promote standards-compatible curriculum resources that teachers can use in government, history, or civics classes. All developed resources will be posted online.</p>

The OFR is also working to update the processing and publication timelines for the U.S. Government Manual. These new efficiencies will allow for more frequent updating of this electronic publication and its underlying raw data.</p>
